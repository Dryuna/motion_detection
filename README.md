# This is my README.

----------------------------------------------------

I created it per the helpful bitbucket instructions.

I'm still new to git, bitbucket, and the like.

Please be gentle.

This tidbit of Python is (hopefully) representative of my second foray into OpenCV motion tracking.

I intend to develop something that can accurately discern humanoid motion (and will not raise false alarms for things like quick changes in lighting conditions).

Ideally, it'll be able to take a feed from a webcam in real time, highlight detected motion, and raise some sort of alarm if the motion detected appears to be humanoid - highlighting also the suspect motion in a screencap (or by emphasizing it in a video feed).

So: this will probably start with a simple `import cv` and we'll see where it goes from there.

I'm also doing this to improve my knowledge of Python.

While I know this is probably reinventing the wheel, I feel like it is a good exercise (and will also be contributing to a personal project).

...the spec for which is quite interesting.

Did you know: `True + True = 2`?

Yup.
